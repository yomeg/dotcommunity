If you want some context onto why we're laying so much groundwork for this online we are creating, it's because it's fragile. Online communities can im/explode even when they've been going strong and are truly places of civil dialogue. 

When we started this project, we had never heard of or read Slate Star Codex, or were aware of the "Culture War Thread." But as soon as we read this blog post we knew it was relevant to what we were trying to create. It provides all the context you need, and is an enlightening perspective into an online community that combusted.

Think of it like an autopsy, performed by cultural coroner.

**Give the whole thing a read, it's time well spent:**
