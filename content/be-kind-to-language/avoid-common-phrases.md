In Timothy Snyder's short book _On Tyranny_, which has "Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century" for resisting fascism, he included a chapter titled "Be kind to our language."

In it, he warns, "Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does." In SJMD, we'll be doing just that.

**When there's a common phrase or jargon that regularly gets used as a shorthand for a more complicated, loaded, controversial, or misunderstood concept, don't use it.**

For a lot of us part of our social justice education was understanding jargon, being able to hear words like neoliberal, capitalist, heterosexistpatriarchy, and use them was part of what it mean to be in these conversations. Here we're going to see what can happen when we leave the jargon out and say what we mean directly.
