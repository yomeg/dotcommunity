Jargon and common phrases often stand-in for one's own lack of understanding of a topic. The words can make us feel competant even when we might be feeling otherwise. We can also fail to unpack them because we _think_ we know what they mean. 

They're also frequently the fork in the road that begins a misunderstanding between two people. Someone might say well I disagree with _concept_ and you might say well I agree with _concept_. And you can have an whole argument without ever defining the word at the center of your argument. 

Additionally, not feeling obligated to be kind, or seeing kindness as beneficial, send us on a destruction mission and can truncate our willingness to endeavor to understand someone else. Or to make ourselves understood.

Finally, dehumanizing someone we disagree with is an easy way to avoid having to engage with them at all while feeling justified in doing so. _Monsters can't understand anyway, and they don't deserve our kindness._

**What happens when we avoid jargon and common phrases, and instead say what we mean? When we do so with kindness? When we rehumanize the people involved, particularly those we disagree with?**

We have a shot at understanding, being understood, of increasing connection (even if not agreement) and creating a space that has room for everyone.
